# Retina Disease Classificaton Chatbot (WIP)
## Purpose 
The WorldÂ Health Organization's 2019 World Report on Vision estimates that there are 2.2 billion visually impaired persons in the globe, at least 1 billion of whom have untreated or preventable vision impairments. When it comes to eye care, the globe has many obstacles, such as disparities in access to and the standard of preventive, treatment, and rehabilitation services. Visual impairment may be prevented if ocular disorders were identified and diagnosed early.
